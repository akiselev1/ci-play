The optional "real" testing can be run by applying the "e2e-test" label to the Pull Request. This will start an action which queues either an end-to-end test (where common code is affected) or runs the specific test modified (when no common code is affected). Because these tests take both time and resources, they should only be started after the PR is ready to merge as a final check of functionality, and this label should only be utilized by repository maintainers. After the test run, the Action will remove the "e2e-test" label.
